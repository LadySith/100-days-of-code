**Today's Progress**: Python refresher by solving Hackerrank challenges

**Thoughts**: These challenges were quite basic. I haven't used Python seriously in over 2 years. I had forgotten how pleasant the syntax is. I will definitely be using this for the Google Hashcode challenge.

**Today's Progress**: Python: More Hackerrank challenges and tkinter.
